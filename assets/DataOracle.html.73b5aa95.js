This places severe limitations on the development of Dapp ecosystems or Layer 2, the infrastructure of Web 3. In the Web 3 world, infrastructures are urgently needed, which means that the smart contracts on the blockchain must be able to interact with external systems to acquire outside data. To address this demand, Datum&#39;s Data Oracle was created. With Data Oracle, users can connect on-chain contracts with external systems and acquire outside data. Moreover, it can also tokenize data services and enable joint computation among multi-parties for on-chain contracts, which creates liquidity value for data in Web 3, as well as a wide selection of application scenarios. Datum&#39;s Data Oracle features an offline and decentralized system. Based on Datum&#39;s bottom layer, it is a decentralized privacy-preserving computation network consisting of the nodes of Datum-network.</p><h2 id="application-scenarios" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#application-scenarios" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Application Scenarios</h2><ul><li>Identity verification</li><li>Credit investigation</li><li>Accredited investor</li><li>Risk control</li><li>Precision marketing</li><li>Data cooperation for authorization and settlement among multi-parties</li><li>Federated machine learning for authorization and settlement among multi-parties</li><li>...</li></ul><h2 id="functions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Functions</h2><ul><li>Provide external data for on-chain smart contracts</li><li>Offer joint multi-party computation service calls to on-chain smart contracts</li></ul><h2 id="how-data-oracle-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-data-oracle-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How Data Oracle Works:</h2><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p>',8),m={id:"please-refer-to-apis-for-data-oracle-for-more-instructions",tabindex:"-1"},f=e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#please-refer-to-apis-for-data-oracle-for-more-instructions","aria-hidden":"true"},"#",-1),p=a(" Please refer to "),_=a("APIs for Data Oracle"),w=a(" for more instructions");function b(D,k){const t=l("RouterLink");return o(),r("div",null,[u,e("h2",m,[f,p,n(t,{to:"/en/APIDescription/DataOracle.html"},{default:s(()=>[_]),_:1}),w])])}const x=i(h,[["render",b],["__file","DataOracle.html.vue"]]);export{x as default};
