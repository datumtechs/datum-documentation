It represents the beginning of the data life circle in Web 3. On Datum, users may choose to store their data via decentralized storage methods such as IPFS and Arweave, as well as cloud storage environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Datum offers a series of service APIs that enable users to transmit and store their data and record the data hash on the blockchain in a suitable manner. As a service provider, Datum provides users with various solutions for data transmission and storage, including raw data connection, data transmission, and data storage &amp; management. The platform also functions as a trusted storage service provider that offers a wide range of convenient services, covering the tokenization, retrieval, and use of data in Web 3, Data Oracle, etc.</p><h2 id="main-functions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#main-functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Main Functions</h2><ul><li><p>Secure Data Storage: Datum supports cloud storage and centralized storage methods such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, as well as decentralized storage methods like IPFS and Arweave</p></li><li><p>Secure Data Transmission to Blockchain: Datum allows users to store the data hash and publish the metadata on the blockchain</p></li><li><p>Verification of Data Consistency: Datum provides consistency verification for the on-chain hash and the raw data stored</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-data-is-securely-transmitted-to-the-blockchain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-data-is-securely-transmitted-to-the-blockchain" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How Data Is Securely Transmitted to the Blockchain</h2><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="publish-metadata" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#publish-metadata" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Publish Metadata</h2><p>After the data enters the Web 3 world through Datum, users can publish the metadata of the data stored through Datum if they wish to make their raw data hosted through decentralized storage methods such as IPFS and Arweave and cloud environments like AWS, Azure and GCP searchable by other Web 3 users, without disclosing any information about the raw data.</p><h2 id="how-metadata-is-published" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-metadata-is-published" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How Metadata Is Published</h2><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p>',11),f={id:"please-refer-to-apis-for-secure-data-transmission-to-blockchain-for-more-specific-usage-instructions",tabindex:"-1"},p=e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#please-refer-to-apis-for-secure-data-transmission-to-blockchain-for-more-specific-usage-instructions","aria-hidden":"true"},"#",-1),b=a(" Please refer to "),_=a("APIs for Secure Data Transmission to Blockchain"),g=a(" for more specific usage instructions");function v(w,k){const t=h("RouterLink");return r(),i("div",null,[m,e("h2",f,[p,b,o(t,{to:"/en/APIDescription/TransferDataOnChain.html"},{default:n(()=>[_]),_:1}),g])])}const A=s(l,[["render",v],["__file","TransferDataOnChain.html.vue"]]);export{A as default};
