The framework is more accessible to AI developers. With Rosetta, AI developers can convert existing AI codes into programs with privacy protection functions by changing only two or three lines of code without having to be an expert on privacy-preserving AI technologies.</p><h3 id="advantages-of-rosetta" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages-of-rosetta" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Advantages of Rosetta</h3><ul><li>Efficient: Rosetta fully uses the industrial-level optimization of the Tensorflow framework to support various platforms</li><li>Easy to use: Users can switch the Tensorflow code to the privacy-preserving computation mode simply by entering one line of code</li><li>Flexible: Rosetta supports multiple privacy-preserving algorithms and can flexibly combine different AI algorithms to adapt to different scenarios</li></ul><h3 id="more-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More Information</h3>',6),p=t("About Rosetta\uFF1A"),d={href:"https://www.matrixelements.com/product/rosetta",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=t("https://www.matrixelements.com/product/rosetta"),f=t("Rosetta GitHub\uFF1A"),u={href:"https://github.com/LatticeX-Foundation/Rosetta",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v=t("https://github.com/LatticeX-Foundation/Rosetta");function _(g,w){const o=c("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),n("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[p,e("a",d,[m,r(o)])]),e("p",null,[f,e("a",u,[v,r(o)])])])}const b=a(l,[["render",_],["__file","ThePrivacy-preservingAIFrameworkRosetta.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
