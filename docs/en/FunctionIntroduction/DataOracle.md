# Data Oracle

## Data Oracle Explained


It is well-known that smart contracts running on a blockchain cannot directly obtain off-chain data or interact with external (off-chain) systems. This places severe limitations on the development of Dapp ecosystems or Layer 2, the infrastructure of Web 3. In the Web 3 world, infrastructures are urgently needed, which means that the smart contracts on the blockchain must be able to interact with external systems to acquire outside data. To address this demand, Datum's Data Oracle was created. With Data Oracle, users can connect on-chain contracts with external systems and acquire outside data. Moreover, it can also tokenize data services and enable joint computation among multi-parties for on-chain contracts, which creates liquidity value for data in Web 3, as well as a wide selection of application scenarios. Datum's Data Oracle features an offline and decentralized system. Based on Datum's bottom layer, it is a decentralized privacy-preserving computation network consisting of the nodes of Datum-network.


## Application Scenarios


- Identity verification
- Credit investigation
- Accredited investor
- Risk control
- Precision marketing
- Joint query & stat for authorization and settlement among multi-parties
- Joint machine learning for authorization and settlement among multi-parties
- ...


## Functions

- Provide external data for on-chain smart contracts
- Offer joint multi-party computation service calls to on-chain smart contracts
